# JwtAuth

## About
 - An application for managing user authentication and authorization with JWTs
 - With support for role-based authentication
 - Create, read, update, and delete users, user profiles, and roles

## Built with
 - .NET 8 / C# 12
 - SQL server database

## My objectives
 - The solution will be a reusable template for my apps that need user identity management
 - The solution will have separation of concerns (ask each class what its job is)
 - The solution will be clean code that is DRY
 - The solution will have thought out return types (what does it make sense to return?)
 - The solution will use the fluent validation library (which I haven't used before - learning something new)
 - The solution will include logging, maybe from an external library (none of my apps has ever included logging, so learning something new here too)
